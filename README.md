# Bootstrap Practice

Starting with the `start.html` pages in `1-grid-practice` and `2-component-practice`, build out the pages to look like the corresponding `target.html` files. 

You may need to add 

    <link rel="stylesheet" href="http://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.4/css/bootstrap.min.css">

to the `<head>` section of your page so Bootstrap gets loaded in. 


**Challenge**

Choose a page in a web app that you frequent and build out a version of it using Bootstrap. Check out an example using the website Kickstarter in the `3-recreation` folder.
